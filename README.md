**YT—mono** is super easy to develop locally: just open `index.html` in your browser!
For instance, since I cloned this repo into my Mac's "Documents" folder, I point my browser to `file:///Users/kofi/Documents/yt/index.html`

# Contributing

Participation is encouraged!
Make issues, ask questions, submit pull requests (even if it’s your first time contributing to open-source — you’ll get lots of help), and give feedback!


### Design Decisions

 - All inputs save their state in the URL so that exact configurations are sharable
 - "Notes" "sound" (i.e. video unmutes) for as long as the MIDI/keyboard key is held (see [#1](https://github.com/hkgumbs/yt/pull/1))
